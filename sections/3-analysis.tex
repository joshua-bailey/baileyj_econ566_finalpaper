\subsection{Model-specific Discussion}

\subsubsection{Lasso}

Bad because maybe you can't improve on normal factor models \autocite{GouletCoulombe2022HowForecasting}

Bad also maybe because no polynomial features. Size of model also meant I had to give it wider paramters to converge.

Tried ot do a polynomial model to increase accuracy (list the strategies) and it was still too large.
